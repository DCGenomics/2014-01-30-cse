Rather than beep 
Or a rude error message: 
These words: "File Not Found". 

Errors have occurred. 
We won't tell you where or why - 
Lazy programmers! 

Chaos reigns within. 
Reflect, repent, and reboot 
Order will return. 

For a new PC, 
Center of my universe, 
I abandon all. 

The code was willing! 
It considered your request, 
But the chips were weak. 

A file that big? 
It might be very useful. 
But now it is gone. 

No keyboard present 
Hit F1 to continue 
Zen engineering? 

Website has been moved 
We'd tell you where, but then we'd 
Have to delete you. 

The web site you seek 
Cannot be located but 
Countless more exist. 

Aborted effort: 
Close all that you have worked on. 
You ask way too much. 

Windows XP crashed. 
I am the blue screen of death. 
No one hears your screams. 

Yesterday it worked. 
Today it is not working. 
Windows is like that. 

Printer not ready. 
Could be a fatal error. 
Have a pen handy? 

With searching comes loss 
And the presence of absence: 
"My novel" not found. 

The Tao that is seen 
Is not the true Tao, until 
You bring fresh toner. 

Stay the patient course. 
Of little worth is your ire. 
The network is down. 

A crash reduces 
Your expensive computer 
To a simple stone. 

Three things are certain: 
Death, taxes, and lost data. 
Guess which has occurred. 

Seeing my great fault 
Through darkening blue windows 
I begin again. 

You step in the stream, 
But the water has moved on. 
This page is not here. 

Out of memory. 
We wish to hold the whole sky, 
But we never will. 

10,000 Things 
How long do any persist? 
Explorer is gone. 

Server: poor response 
Not quick enough for browser 
Time out, plum blossom. 

Having been erased, 
The document you're seeking 
Must now be retyped. 

Serious error. 
All shortcuts have disappeared. 
Screen. Mind. Both are blank.
